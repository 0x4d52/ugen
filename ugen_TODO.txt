UGen to do list:


TODO
- rethink the KR stuff again at some point - 
- use templates and virtual functions to rewrite the Binary/Unary op stuff? (this might actually be one place where macros are better but it is difficult to debug using the macros)
- add a (non-pure) virtual function to the VoicerEventBase which controls the voice stealing priority so this can be customised by the user?
- get Buffer to check if a file is valid before trying to use it


DONE
- need to test the getChannel() stuff again (haven't checked it works properly for a while)
- test the Delay Ugens after the change to the way inputs are handled (these may have got broken)
- test the Plug shouldDelete stuff 
- remove SC style ar/kr calls?
- Amplitude UGen
- sustaining/releasing envelopes via a ReleasableUGenInternal class, then UGens can be told to release which will iterate through its graph releasing any ReleasableUGenInternal subclasses
- add thr AR and KR static UGen methods to: Mix, DiskIn, DiskOut, all the Spawns?
- there is a bug when the final output array of UGens conatains the same internal ugens 
	e.g. a = WhiteNoise::AR(); b = UGen(a, a); b.setOutputs(...) etc
	...since the internal UGens have only one output channel buffer and gets changed twice using setOutputs() hmmm!!!!!
	(solved with the Thru UGen)
- noise ugens including UGen++'s own random number generator (independent of rand() for example)
- need to add getChannel() to MulAdd
- need to add getChannel() to Dust
- how about a MapUGenInternal that is a MulAdd an uses a buffer for lookup
- TSpawn needs a more custom Event due to the extraArgs
- template the Spawn (etc) classes
- Delay classes need tweaks, - if the max = delay then the delay is actually zero! fixed
- bug in Lag::KR - doesn't work ! (Decay:KR probably doesn't work either then) fixed
- LFNoise0, 1, 2
- other areas for multichannel expansion e.g., Line, XLine have float inlets, perhaps they could have Buffer inlets which expand (started this)
- added sloping to LFPulse::KR, perhaps add this to other KRs?
- fixed a bug in MulAdd which may not generate enough channels
- FSinOsc
- Chain ?? - a UGen that somehow passes its output to the input of the next UGen - this would be to avoid excessively long call stacks (e.g., Allpass-based reverbs)
- added a Value class
- Added a RecircBaseChain which uses Values to specify
- a ValueUGen which evaluates a value every samples (AR) or control block (KR)
- need to add the unary - operator and binary / operators to Value
- function UGEen too? perhaps this could be a templated Value class?
- Passing in a specific Event to a Spawn (etc) class
- LoopValue? - implemented usng the existing Geom and Series classes
- opposite of Chain - Bank? done
- add audio input to the AudioQueusIOHostController for iPhone
- there's a bug in the Voicer where the envelopes are a fixed duration, perhaps release() should be ignored if releaseNode==-1 ??
