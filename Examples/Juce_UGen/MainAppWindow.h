 MainAppWindow.h :
 
 This file is just a declaration of the MainAppWindow class. For more
 detailed information of its purpose, examine the MainAppWindow.cpp
 file.
 
 Having it as a separate header file may seem pointless, but it could
 save a bit of effort should you be embarking on a complex project and
 wish to still use this fileset as a starting point.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Please feel free to do whatever you like with this code, bearing in mind that
 it's not guaranteed to be bug-free!

		// content component as the 'base' level of the application; it can be responsible
		// for storing and maintaining anything considered crucial to the running of the
		// program.
		
		// However, if you want to have anything live above even that, you may
		// want to put it here. You may even wish to step further outside of things and keep
		// some higher management system within the JUCEApplication class that drives the
		// whole shebang, but that's probably not necessary, and can be tricky to maintain!
