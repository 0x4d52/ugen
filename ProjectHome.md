UGen++ is a audio processing and synthesis framework in C++. It provides oscillators, filters, envelopes and event management etc. There are starter projects for Mac (using Juce), Windows (using Juce) and iPhone.

Check out the most recent [Download](http://code.google.com/p/ugen/downloads/list) for a stable version of the library or the Source tab for a more recent, work in progress version.

There are more tutorials and full Doxygen-generated documentation. You can view this [within the Google Code project](APIReference.md) or [in the window on its own](http://ugen.googlecode.com/svn/doc/index.html). The latter may be better if you plan to print the documentation.

If you have an Issue with the project (bug report, feature request or contribution) please use the [Issues tab](http://code.google.com/p/ugen/issues/list) and the corresponding template. You can also discuss UGen++ here: [http://groups.google.com/group/ugenpp](http://groups.google.com/group/ugenpp)

Above all have fun using the library and any feedback is greatly appreciated.
